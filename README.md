# Solar-System

CSU44052 - Computer Graphics @ TCD Final Project.

The objective of this project was to create an animated 3D scene using shader-based OpenGL.

Required Features for this project included:
* 3D objects and views
* User interaction and camera control
* At least one hierarchical animated objected (minimum of a single one-to-one hierarchy)
* Texture Mapping
* Phong Illumination Model

My project consists of a Solar System scene with the planets rotating around the Sun. All of the required features above have been implemented within this project:
* All of the visible objects within the scene are 3D, created by me in Blender. The models range from simple (the planets/Sun) to more complex (the spaceship).
* The camera can be controlled through user input, the arrow keys on the keyboard allow the user to move around the scene.
* The rotation of the planets make up a one-to-many hierarchy. Further hierarchies include the Moon rotating around Earth and the rings around Saturn.
* All objects are texture mapped using appropriate textures to represent the correct planet/object.
* The Sun object is lit and shaded using the Phong Illumination Model.
